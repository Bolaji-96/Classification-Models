## Background
Stroke is  a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. This dataset contains multiple variables which can be used to predict if a patient is likely to have stroke or not. Examples of the variables in the data includes:
Gender, Age, Average Glucose Level, BMI, Residence type, Work type, Hypertension. 

## Problem Statement 
In order to predict whether a patient is likely to have stroke or not, I have used two models (Logistic Regression and Decision Trees) to classify the target variable. 

## Libraries Used 
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SKlearn. 

## Results & Conclusion 
After fitting both models, the Decision Trees edges the Logistic Regression with an AUC of 0.85.
